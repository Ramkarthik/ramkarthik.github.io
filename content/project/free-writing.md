<a href="https://freewriting.club">Free Writing</a> is an app that I built to help writer's overcome writer's block. The app is based on a process called Free Writing, where the writer sets a specific time and writes without any filter process till a set time.

<p>It is build using VanillaJS, HTML and CSS. For CSS, instead of the regular Bootstrap theme which I favor, I used Skeleton. It is a minimal CSS library and saves significant amount of bandwidth.</p>
